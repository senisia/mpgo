# mpgo

simple mp3 player with go, plays in terminal, built with beep and bubbletea, music files should be in ~/music, i dont know the equivalent of tilde in windows so you should figure it out yourself

the reason i created this project is i was using mpd (music player daemon) with ncmpcpp and it didnt work for me so i just started this project with none go knowledge, i loved the language,
im gonna make it better soon
